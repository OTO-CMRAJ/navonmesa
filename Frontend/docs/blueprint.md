## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep turquoise (#46C4C7), fostering a sense of trust and innovation within the financial context.
- Background color: Light gray (#EAEAEA), providing a neutral and clean backdrop to ensure readability and focus on content.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#77D8D8) used for interactive elements such as buttons and links, to draw attention and indicate interactivity, also complementing the primary turquoise hue.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' lends a modern and slightly technical edge for headlines, paired with the highly readable 'Inter' for body content, enhancing the user experience.
- Use consistent, professional line icons related to finance, investment, and startups.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout with clear visual hierarchy, prioritizing key information and ensuring a professional appearance.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance the user experience, such as loading indicators or button hover effects.
